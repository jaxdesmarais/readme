This is a space for me to write about my experience in my first Engineering role. I hope to write about my experience each week to look back on and hopefully learn from myself.

## Week of November 16th
### Successes
* I did it! Week 1 of being an iOS Engineer in the book
* I attended a ton of meetings, went to a bunch of trainings
* I walked a colleague through what I know in our codebase and did okay, so that was cool

### Surprises
* I was told that my syntax understanding was good, which was refreshing
* The code I saw looked similar to what I have been writing, so that felt like I've been learning the right things
* so. many. files

### Personal Life
* Pandemic stress/anxiety is real - I am feeling it this week and the new job is additional stress because I am the new guy
* My close friend in Australia got some devastating news so that's been stressful this week
