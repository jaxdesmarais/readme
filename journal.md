This is a space for me to write about my experience in my first Engineering role. I hope to write about my experience each week to look back on and hopefully learn from myself. My goal is to add some notes at least once a month, but sometimes I'll probably be bad at that.

## Week of April 5th

### Successes
* We released our SDK as part of our soft-launch - it's out in the wild and people are using it!
* Continuing to get more comfomrtable with the work and just being an Engineer - some days are better than others

### Surprises
* Things are starting to click a bit more and that feeling is really cool. I still feel like I'm behind on some things but hoping that gets better over time.

### Personal Life
* Got my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine
* We are still working on home projects - finishing up the sunroom and the garden then moving on to the coffee bar area
* Finally starting to get some nice weather in Chicago, which is much needed and so nice

## Week of March 1st
Ooops, I forgot a whole month - not too suprised, it was really busy

### Successes
* Myself and a colleague merged a huuuuuuge PR that had been open for 2.5 months and was around 2,500 lines of code
* Merging some small PRs here and there and just generally starting to feel like I understand things a bit more

### Surprises
* During my review my boss and I talked about me moving to the next level in the next review cycle - I don't feel ready for that so trying to get over the general imposture syndrome there

### Personal Life
* My wife started a new job
* Our daugher turned 2
* We got like 2 feet of snow
* I get my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow

## Week of January 18th
### Successes
* My code is out in the wild and that feels very weird/cool
* I am starting to feel more comfortable with day to day work which is refreshing

### Surprises
* I feel like I am getting to the point where I can contribute to meetings more, which is really dope - I think I expected that to take waaaay longer
* I had a 1:1 with my boss and we talked through just the genrals of taking time to learn and how he can support me in that

### Personal Life
* 1 week until Valerie is 2!
* House projects are still chugging along but it still feels like the list is endless some days - I know we will get there

## Week of January 11th
### Successes
* I merged my first PR - my code will now be in the wild
* My tasks are going well once I got on a roll but still slow to start

### Surprises
* I am starting to udnerstand what people mean by their PR comments instead of mostly being confused

### Personal Life
* We owned our house for a year today - what a wild ride
* Valerie also turns 2 in two weeks which is also wild/cool

## Week of December 14th
### Successes
* I put up my first PR, it was small and I needed a lot of help but I did it
* Also pushed up some other code for a future PR that took a bit and was a really long model

### Surprises
* Slowly starting to understand our codebase and how everything works together

### Personal Life
* The kiddo was home with us all last week due to a covid scare at school we all tested negative but it certainly made for an interesting week

## Week of November 16th
### Successes
* I did it! Week 1 of being an iOS Engineer in the book
* I attended a ton of meetings, went to a bunch of trainings
* I walked a colleague through what I know in our codebase and did okay, so that was cool

### Surprises
* I was told that my syntax understanding was good, which was refreshing
* The code I saw looked similar to what I have been writing, so that felt like I've been learning the right things
* so. many. files

### Personal Life
* Pandemic stress/anxiety is real - I am feeling it this week and the new job is additional stress because I am the new guy
* My close friend in Australia got some devastating news so that's been stressful this week
