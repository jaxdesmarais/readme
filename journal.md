This is a space for me to write about my experience in my first Engineering role. I hope to write about my experience each week to look back on and hopefully learn from myself. My goal is to add some notes at least once a month, but sometimes I'll probably be bad at that.

## Week of December 14th
### Successes
* I put up my first PR, it was small and I needed a lot of help but I did it
* Also pushed up some other code for a future PR that took a bit and was a really long model

### Surprises
* Slowly starting to understand our codebase and how everything works together

### Personal Life
* The kiddo was home with us all last week due to a covid scare at school we all tested negative but it certainly made for an interesting week

## Week of November 16th
### Successes
* I did it! Week 1 of being an iOS Engineer in the book
* I attended a ton of meetings, went to a bunch of trainings
* I walked a colleague through what I know in our codebase and did okay, so that was cool

### Surprises
* I was told that my syntax understanding was good, which was refreshing
* The code I saw looked similar to what I have been writing, so that felt like I've been learning the right things
* so. many. files

### Personal Life
* Pandemic stress/anxiety is real - I am feeling it this week and the new job is additional stress because I am the new guy
* My close friend in Australia got some devastating news so that's been stressful this week
