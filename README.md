## About Me

Hello, I am Jax (he/him). I was born in Redford, MI and was raised in Murfreesboro, TN where my parents still live. I am also a [transgender man](http://pinkmantaray.com/terminology), which influences my day to day in tech as well as pushing for a better future for people like me both inside and outside of the tech space. I am known to push my coworkers to help find more welcoming spaces for underserved communities in and outside of work and ask that you push me to be a better ally for any communities you are passionate about/identities/experiences you hold.

Before moving into tech, I worked for a decade in the specialty coffee industry as a trainer and educator. I also competed on a national level and eventually moved to coaching where I helped coach both national and world barista champions. I can give you both the filtered and non filtered opinion of many coffee companies because the coffee community is quite small. If you're traveling, I can likely give you recommendations on coffee shops. Education wise, I went to University of Michigan on a swimming scholarship, but eventually dropped out of school for personal reasons.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years but have been friends for around 15 years. We own a 1920s dutch colonial revival home in Oak Park, IL that we are lovingly renovating/restoring mostly ourselves. We have a little one (2 in January) as well as 2 dogs (mutt and a llasa apso) and a cat. When we aren't working on our house, we can be found gardening, walking around Oak Park, visiting the Shedd Aqaurium, or hanging out with friends (in non-covid times).

My personal hobbies include: amateur woodworking, making cocktails, and watching sports (mainly University of Michigan football/basketball and the Cubs), and getting tattooed. We also enjoy traveling and exploring new cities when we are able as well as spending time with our families spread out all over the US.

## When, Where and How I Work

Central time, as I am based just outside of Chicago, typically 8am - 4pm. After a decade in coffee and a toddler, I am very into mornings and this is when my focus is highest, so have been known to start as early as 7am at times, but I often use that time to do some reading and have some coffee. I enjoy working at home 2-3 days a week for more focused time and 2-3 days a week in office (mainly motivated by donuts). I tend to take lunch around noon Central until around 12:30pm or so and try to take a mid-morning or mid-afternoon walk to clear/reset my head for around 15 minutes. My hard stop time is 5pm as that's when our kiddo gets home from daycare.

## How to Talk with Me

My preferred communication method is Slack. I am an inbox 0 guy, so have a hard time letting notifications/alerts go unread (this is something I am working on). I tend to try not to reply to Slack outside of working hours and will set reminders to get back to messages at a later time.

I am the type of person that needs time to think/digest information and do not generally enjoy being put on the spot. I excel when I have a chance to digest information before hopping into a meeting especially if the meeting will require team discussion/input. I tend to avoid conflict and prefer people to be direct in their communication. I am most open in 1:1 settings which can be done via slack/in person/teams through written or video chats.

## Motivation

I am motivated by work that feels both important and valued as well as pushes the boundaries or current constructs. My values are to do the right thing the first time vs the wrong thing many times. This leads me to ask questions, seek to understand, and challenge things I think can be further clarified. I also think a lot about the end user/customer as a driving factor for decisions. I tend to also think about accessibility in tech quite a lot, so ask a lot of clarifying questions around this aspect of products. I like to be challenged and learn new things as well as push my own personal knowledge and skillset constantly.
