## What I do
I am currently an iOS Engineer at PayPal

## How I got here
Before working in tech, I worked in the specialty coffee industry for a decade. I spent my initial years in coffee as a barista before moving to training and education. I also lead the competiton team for two companies after having competed myself for several years. I was very successful and well known within the industry, but had reached the top of my career path and looking to work less than 50 hours a week and move to a more lucrative career.

Late in my coffee career, I attended a coding bootcamp (Actualize in Chicago). While my personal focus was on iOS, our bootcamp was mainly Rails based. My capstone project included both an iOS and Web based app. While the bootcamp certainly helped start to instill confidence, looking back, I should have spent more time finding mobile based bootcamps as that is the path I wanted to be on. In any case, learning syntax and troubleshooting in one language certainly translates as you move to others.

In 2017, just before my bootcamp capstone, I started a role on the Technical Support team at Braintree. Throughout my time on the team, I was able to build troubleshooting skills, work on iOS tickets as I was able, and do some self learning at times. I moved from the Technical Support team to the API Support team just over a year later.

Right after joining the API Support team, we welcomed our daughter into the family. This was much of my focus for around 9 months and I very much took a break from programming during this time. After that time, I spent some time (3ish months) really exploring languages, but always came back to iOS.

For the next 11 months, I spent some time really focusing on iOS. I've shared resources that I found helpful below as my path was self taught. For the last 2.5-3 months preparing for interviews, I spent 1 hour a week with a mentor. Us getting paired up was very organic, we just meshed, and it worked well. I had worked with 3 other mentors previously that we just didn't work well together. You know pretty quick if you'll work together well or not.

A few caveats that I should note:

* I do not believe in college education - I think pushing college for Engineers is gatekeeping at it's finest
* I am a reader - I don't do well with long video courses, if videos are your main source of learning, the below will likely not be helpful as there is only 1 main video course included
* I have not been programming since I was a kid, I didn't mess with HTML/CSS on myspace, we didn't have computers in school until I was in late middle school
* I very much was in the right place at the right time with my career, not to say I didn't work my ass off, but my hard work was matched by managers that pushed and challenged me to grow
* While I am transgender, I am still a cis passing white guy in tech - while I am still finding my voice, I recognize that I am privileged in this industry and am learning to navigate this privilege to better tech
* I believe anyone can learn programming if they put in the time and don't mind starting at the bottom - when I previously hired folks in coffee, I always said you could teach anyone to make coffee but you can't teach them to be nice, I believe the same goes for roles in Engineering
* I don't often program outside of work, never have never will - I worked in an industry I was passionate about for a decade and it destroyed me, I do not plan to repeat this


## Resources "Year 1"
I am considering anything I did to prep and prepare/learn before landing my first iOS job "year 1". I plan to update this in subsequent years as I continue to move from junior to _hopefully_ higher levels.

* Building and troubleshooting integrations - this was part of my role on API Support, but I made a point to take every iOS ticket I could to continue to level up my skills and get practice looking at and troubleshooting code
* [100 days of Swift - Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) - I went through this course once early in my iOS learning and again pre interview, the team I currently work on build all views programmatically so I worked through the challenges building the views programmatically instead of through IB
* [Mastering Swift 5 Book](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Swift-latest-programming-language-ebook/dp/B07RD3P9PY) - I bought the paperback of this book and took notes on my iPad via the Notability app as I read this book

### Projects
In addition to the above, I worked on the following projects:
* Building a flicker API app using MVVM and programatic layouts - this is something my mentor and I worked on, he would give me a few things to add each week and I would spend time each day working on it my [repo can be found here](https://github.com/jaxdesmarais/flickerTableViewApp)
* My mentor also gave me some challenges that I worked on during pair programming sessions with him - these were things like algorithm problems, parsing data, and building out protocols and classes

### Interview Prep
* [Ray Wenderlich interview questions](https://www.raywenderlich.com/762435-swift-interview-questions-and-answers) - I made flashcards and practiced these throughout the day
* Flashcards I made from the Mastering Swift 5 book
* Running through the algorithm problems my mentor and I worked on
* [Swift Coding Challenges book](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/swift-coding-challenges) - I worked through these problems (mainly the easy and second level)
